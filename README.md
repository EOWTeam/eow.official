Knowledge is Power，Intelligence is Wealth


EOW is a BasS open platform which enables the traditional IP industry with blockchain capabilities, to reconstruct the relationship among authors, readers and investors which can improve the creativity of authors, invokes the enthusiasm of all participants to make the IP more and more valuable. 

To achieve this mission, in the past 24 hours, my friends and I created an MVP Model of EOW platform. 

In this Model, there is a Literature website Named MM provides EOW services to its users. And all the users have their own EOW wallet. 

By signing an EOW IP Smart Contract, a novel author issues one dividable token named MSP stands for the right of the future earnings of this IP, and 3 non-dividable tokens stand for the rights of video adaptation, game adaptation and the paper book publishing.

That means, if the owner of the IP makes any revenue from these 3 rights in the future, the revenue will be divided and allocated to MSP holders based on the portion they hold. 

For example, Reader A buys 1000 MSP tokens  with 1000 EOW.

One year later, a game company buys 10 years of the IP right of game adaptation  with 200,000,000EOW. And reader A get 2000EOW as profit share. 

OK, that’s the MVP model. The core of the platform is the EOW-IP Smart Contract. The readers will become the investor while reading.  

In the future, besides  the literature website, the EOW Services can also access to the mobile reading apps, the personal blog of independent writers, IP incubators and so on.  With the increasing number of categories of IP tokens, the demands of exchange and IP trading market will appear. Then the new type IP ecosystem grows. 

We will set up suitable incentive mechanism base on EOW coins to develop the communities of writers, readers, investors, lawyer, developers and other specialists. Our mission is to make the IP ecosystem  grow from a liquid organization to an exponential organization.
